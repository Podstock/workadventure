## Version 1.3.9 - in dev

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Scripting API:
  - Changed function names: `restorePlayerControl` => `restorePlayerControls`, `disablePlayerControl` => `disablePlayerControls`.
    Please keep in mind that the scripting API is still experimental. Some breaking changes can occur in it until we mark it as stable.

### Updates

- Added the emote feature to WorkAdventure. (@Kharhamel, @Tabascoeye)
  - The emote menu can be opened by clicking on your character. 
  -  Clicking on one of its element will close the menu and play an emote above your character. 
  -  This emote can be seen by other players.
- Mobile support has been improved
  - WorkAdventure automatically sets the zoom level based on the viewport size to ensure a sensible size of the map is visible, whatever the viewport used
  - Mouse wheel support to zoom in / out
  - Pinch support on mobile to zoom in / out
  - Improved virtual joystick size (adapts to the zoom level)
- New scripting API features:
  - Use `WA.loadSound(): Sound` to load / play / stop a sound

### Bug Fixes
